# About

NHSbuntu is an Ubuntu-based Linux operating system for the NHS

It is intended to be a free OS that can work in both clinical and non-clinical NHS settings, and comes with the right stuff to be productive out of the box.

# Features

* Long term supported Ubuntu 16.04 LTS base
* NHS Spine Two-factor Authentication (Smart Cards and Oxygen) built in, making Spine-approved 2FA a first-class citizen in the OS, not a bolt on SSO hack, or a creaky Java system-tray app
* Offline, secure Voice recognition capability

# Our Ethos
* we understand why the needs of healthcare differ from other types of enterprise, and have built NHSbuntu accordingly.
* we know that the NHS delivers healthcare in an unique way, which is why we've set up NHSbuntu to be more bothered with productivity than billing.


# Advantages
* Benefits from Linux's inbuilt multi-user architecture
* Low system requirements mean it performs well even on older hardware
