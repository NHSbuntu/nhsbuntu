# List of .desktop file names (without extension) with additional default launchers
#
# Format: arbitrarily many lines, one .desktop name (without extension) per line
# An optional second word on the line specifies the package name which
# provides this desktop file; this will be added to the defaults package's
# dependencies, just like if it were added to "depends.txt".
#
# Example:
# gnome-sudoku
# simple-scan
# sol aisleriot
