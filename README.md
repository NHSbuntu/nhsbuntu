# About


NHSbuntu is a free, Ubuntu-based Linux operating system for the NHS


It is intended to be a free OS that can work in both clinical and non-clinical NHS settings, and comes with the right stuff to be productive out of the box.


# Features

* **Long term supported Ubuntu 16.04 LTS base** means we can benefit from the stable codebase and huge app ecosystem of one of the most popular Linux variants.
* **NHS Spine Two-factor Authentication** (Smart Cards and Oxygen) built in, making Spine-approved 2FA a first-class citizen in the OS, not a bolt on SSO hack, or a creaky Java system-tray app
* **Multi-environment** - Works as a clinical OS, an office desktop OS, as a Kiosk for simple transactions and displays, and 
* **Voice recognition Input** - offline and secure, it makes data input super-fast, satisfies Information Governance requirements and can be used for Patient Identifiable Data (PID).
* **Office Applications** - a complete office suite comes built into NHSbuntu, saving trusts thousands in licensing fees for proprietary office suites.
* Android containerization - use Android apps on NHSbuntu in the Desktop Mode, in Kiosk Mode, even on a Raspberry Pi
* **Remote Help** - built in standards-compliant remote help system
* **Patient information displays** - display health promotion information, important organisation-wide bulletins, or real-time alerts and waiting times to your patients
* **Dashboard and Analytics** - built in tools and prebuilt dashboards for the most common NHS targets and KPIs
* **Clinicians are Power Users!** - you want to be able to optimise your workflow and have predictable, industry standard keyboard shortcuts that work across all your applications
* **Per-user customisations** - synchronised between logins, from a secure settings sync server you control. Clinicians can customise their environments to optimise their efficiency, automate workflows
* **Launch applications and workflows from the keyboard** - built-in extensible Launcher app saves time and improves productivity.
* **Secure Instant Messaging for NHS Teams** - IM hosted inside the Health and Social Care Network, complete with desktop, iOS and Android mobile clients, and designed for the kinds of teams that exist in the NHS.


# Advantages

* free!
* open source - no vendor lockin
* Benefits from Linux's inbuilt multi-user architecture, and over a decade of Ubuntu's refinements and improvements.
* Low system requirements mean it performs well even on older hardware.
* Automatic security updates, to reduce risk of malware and virus attacks that can cause downtime or a catastrophic patient data leak.
* Designed for highly automatable remote management and optimisation of machines, saving your IT team money and time.


# Our Ethos
* We understand that the needs of healthcare differ from other types of enterprise, and have built NHSbuntu accordingly.
* We know that the NHS delivers healthcare in an unique way, which is why we've set up NHSbuntu to be more bothered with productivity than billing.
* Medicine, as a profession, has always understood the need to share information and learning so that the next generation of medicine advances from this one. We believe that this should include the software that we use to deliver medical care. Open source software is a way to share and build on the best, and provide every NHS institution with the very latest and best 


# Roadmap
