# Language support included on built installer images. The user can still
# select a different language than the ones included here, the language packs
# and support packages will then be downloaded from the network.
# Note that this does not affect package dependencies, only image builds, as
# the set of support packages depends on the installed applications.
#
# Format: arbitrarily many lines, one language code per line. If the second
# column is "complete", all additional support packages like LibreOffice help,
# input methods, dictionaries etc. will be installed in addition; otherwise
# only the language packs with the translations will be installed. Note that
# complete language support takes a lot of CD space.
#
# Example:
# de complete
# es
# zh-hans
